# How to Play

## Goal

Fill the 9×9 grid with digits 1–9 so that:

- Each row contains 1–9 exactly once
- Each column contains 1–9 exactly once
- Each 3×3 box contains 1–9 exactly once

## Controls

- Click an empty cell to select it
- Tap a number (1–9) in the bottom row to fill it
- Tap “Clear” to erase the selected cell
- Tap “Hint” to reveal the correct digit for the selected cell (counts as a hint)

## Tips

- Start where there are fewer possibilities
- If a cell has only one valid digit, fill it first
